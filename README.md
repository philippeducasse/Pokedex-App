# CareerFoundry Fullstack Immersion 

**Achievement One**


## The Project

In this project, I had to write the code for retrieving data from an external API using Javascript. The app designed retrieves Pokémon data from the API and loads the Pokémon names on the screen. Each name corresponds to a button, and when the button is clicked additional details, such as weight, height, type of pokémon, and an image is displayed. These details are again loaded asychronously from the API.

Initally, vanilla JavaScript was used. The first few tasks consisted of learning the basics of Javascript, learning concept such as variables, conditionals, functions, and more. Concretely, I used a forEach loop running through an array to display names on a screen. I then moved on to loading this array dynamically, using JSON objects, DOM interaction, and Ajax. After loading the array of Pokemons onto the browser, I then had to create modals that oppened and displayed the details in a modal window. I also looked into an alternative to vanilla JS, Jquery. Finally, I appplied some styling to the app by using an UI Interface, Bootstrap.

## Skills Acquired

- Javascript basics
- DOM interaction 
- Jquery basics
- Ajax
- Bootstrap
- Debugging

## Challenges Faced

The most challenging aspect of this achievement was understanding functional programming using vanilla JS. Having only been exposed to HTML and CSS so far, learning JS proved to be much more demanding; as I did not have the direct feedback that html and CSS provide. Instead, I learned how to read error messages, and try to understand, disect and debug JS code. 

Another, more specific challenge faced was that I found it very hard to display the images of the Pokémons in the modal. Initially i did not quite undertand the syntax used to acces specific properties, so this made retrieving them quite challenging.
