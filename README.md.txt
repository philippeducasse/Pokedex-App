In this project, a Pok√©dex was created, which is an web application
that displays Pokemons and their characteristics when the user clicks on their individual names.

The project was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, JSon, and Bootstrap.

First, a basic skeleton using HTML and JS was designed, in order to create a function which displayed the
pokemon names and their characteristics. Json was then implemented to retrieve the information from the 
API. The next step was to create a modal which displayed the pokemon details only when the user clicks on their 
name. Finally, the UI library Bootstrap was implemented to stylise the app.

Dependencies: latest JS version, JSON, Jquery.

API: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=150
